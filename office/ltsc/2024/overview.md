# Overview of Office LTSC 2024

Office LTSC 2024 is the most recent edition of Microsoft's productivity software, available to organizations through volume licensing agreements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Office LTSC 2024 is distinct from Office offered through Microsoft 365 plans. For instance, if your organization has already deployed Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise, there's no need for Office LTSC 2024. Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise includes all the features of Office LTSC 2024, plus many additional features not found in Office LTSC 2024.

Enterprise administrators can download and deploy Office LTSC 2024 to users within their organization. The following volume licensed Office products are available for devices running Windows:

- Office LTSC Professional Plus 2024
- Office LTSC Standard 2024
- Project Professional 2024
- Project Standard 2024
- Visio LTSC Professional 2024
- Visio LTSC Standard 2024
 
These Office products use Click-to-Run as the installation technology, rather than Windows Installer (MSI). However, activation methods, such as using Key Management Service (KMS), remain unchanged.

Office LTSC 2024 is supported on the following operating systems:

- Windows 11<sup>*</sup>
- Windows 10
- Windows 10 LTSC 2021
- Windows 10 LTSC 2019
- Windows Server 2022

<sup>*</sup> For Arm-based devices, Windows 11 is the minimum supported version.

To run Office LTSC 2024, your device should have at least a 1.1 GHz, 2-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, 4 GB of available disk space, and a display with a resolution of 1280 x 768 (64-bit Office required for 4K and higher).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For Arm-based devices, Windows 11 is the minimum supported version.

For detailed system requirements, see [System requirements for Microsoft 365 and Office](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-and-office-resources#areaheading-oce1c3).

For devices running macOS, <!-- Add versions of availabe office here --> is available for volume licensed customers. For more information, see [Deployment guide for Office for Mac](/microsoft-365-apps/mac/deployment-guide-for-office-for-mac).
