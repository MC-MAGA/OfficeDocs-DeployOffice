# Connected buildings

You can use existing sensor data to enhance Places Analytics reports by combining the actual usage with the intended usage of a customerâ€™s conference rooms and buildings. Microsoft Places supports binary occupancy (motion), people density, badge, and Wi-Fi data types.

## Prerequisites

> Connected Workplace is an opt-in feature. For more information, see [Opt in to the Microsoft Places Public Preview](opt-in-places-preview.md).

You must do the following before using the Connected Workplace:

- Create buildings and floors
