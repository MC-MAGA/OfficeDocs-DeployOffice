# Remove-Place

Use the Remove-Place cmdlet to delete buildings or floors from your Places directory.

> [!NOTE] 
> Rooms and workspaces continue to be removeable using Exchange [Remove-Mailbox](../powershell/module/exchange/remove-mailbox).

## Syntax
```powershell
Remove-Place
   [-Id]
```

## Description
You need to be assigned permissions before you can run this cmdlet. You must have either the Exchange MailRecipients role or the Places TenantPlacesManagement role.

You cannot remove a place that is a parent of other places.  Before removing a place, clear the parentId value of its existing child places before attempting to remove.  As an example, clear the ParentId value on all rooms associated with a given floor before deleting that floor.

> [!CAUTION] 
> You might find additional parameters in the PowerShell cmdlet, but those are not currently supported. It is not recommended to use any parameter that is not documented on this page.

## Examples

### Example 1
Delete a floor based on its PlaceId.
```powershell
Remove-Place -Id 86897e93-bcef-4c05-af9d-45116dda791f 
```

## Parameters
### -Id
The identity parameter specifies the place that you want to view. You can use any value that uniquely identifies a place.

> [!NOTE] 
> This will soon be renamed to -Identity to be consistent with the other cmdlets.

For example, for places based on a mailbox (conference rooms and workspaces):

* Name
* Alias
* Distinguished name (DN)
* Canonical DN
* Email address
* GUID

For example, for places that are not based on a mailbox (buildings and floors):

* Name_PlaceId
* PlaceId
