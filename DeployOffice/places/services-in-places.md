# Services in Places

In Microsoft Places apps [LINK to all type of places apps supported], admins can add services that will appear in the Explore tab within Places. These services can be added per building [LINK to what a building is] to provide employees with all the services that each building offers. For example, a building might have a cafeteria where employees can order food online. Admins have the ability of showing employees a link to another website that may simply show the cafeteria menu or an app that employees should use to order food online. The following is an example of how services (both links and apps) might appear.
