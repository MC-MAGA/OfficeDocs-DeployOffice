# Expanding presence to include work location in Microsoft Teams

Your work location, part of your profile in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft 365, can help you manage and share your work schedule. Your profile allows you to specify details about your work schedule: from where you’re working (in the office or remotely) and whether you work different hours on different days. You can schedule meetings with others based on their work profiles, view work locations on other people’s profile cards, and see out of office time reflected in your location.

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> The Microsoft Teams public preview is an opt-in feature. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams Public preview](/microsoftteams/public-preview-doc-updates?tabs=new-teams-client).

## What’s new (public preview)

Many companies have multiple buildings, on-site work options, and scheduling choices. Microsoft Teams is introducing the ability for you to set and view specific work times and locations. Your profile card makes it easier for people in your organization (including guest accounts) to quickly get an overview of your online status, work hours, and work location (remote, in office, or working from a specific building).
