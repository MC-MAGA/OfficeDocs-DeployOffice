# Expanding Presence to include Work location in Microsoft Teams

Work location is part of a user's profile in Microsoft Teams (and throughout Microsoft 365). Users can set up their work location for the day in Microsoft Teams thereby sharing visibility of where they will be working: in-office or remotely. This makes it easier to coordinate collaboration and in-person meetings. By default, anyone in an organization using Teams can see locations set by others.
