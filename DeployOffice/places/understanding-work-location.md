# Expanding Presence to include Work location in Microsoft Teams

Work location is part of a user's profile in Microsoft Teams (and throughout Microsoft 365). Users can set up work location for the day in Microsoft Teams thereby sharing visibility of which days they will be in-office or working remotely, making it easier to coordinate in-person meetings. By default, anyone in the organization using Teams can see the location set by others.
