# Microsoft Places Analytics

Microsoft Places Analytics is designed for real-estate and property managers and admins who need data-driven insights for effective space management. By using Places Analytics, you get a unified view of all your managed spaces, from buildings and rooms to shared workspaces.

You can improve workplace efficiency by comparing planned versus actual attendance by using organization-level data. Discover which desks and rooms are most frequently used and receive suggestions on how to adjust your spaces to better meet your needs. Additionally, Places Analitics helps you identify supply and demand imbalances so that you can allocate resources more effectively.â€¯ 

Places Analytics also helps you track trends of key buildings, bookable rooms, and shared work spaces. Get metrics at both the floor level and specific room/desk pool level to identify opportunities for optimization. Compare intended usage with actual usage across different space types to understand user behavior patterns. You can use this data to refine your hybrid work and change management policies effectively.
