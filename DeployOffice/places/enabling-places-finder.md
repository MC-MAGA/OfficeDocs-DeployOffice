# Enabling Places Finder in Outlook

Places Finder is a web-based feature that exists in Places to help employees find available conference [rooms](/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes) and [workspaces](/exchange/troubleshoot/outlook-issues/create-book-workspace-outlook). It has improved functionality from the existing Room Finder for employees to confidently choose the right place to meet and work productively.

## Overview of Places Finder

Like Room Finder, every meeting room and workspace must be set up in Exchange Online. Each of these spaces must be configured to have either a room mailbox or a workspace mailbox as a specific type of resource mailbox.  

For existing room and workspace mailboxes, Places Finder relies on a new location hierarchy to ensure all [rooms](/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes) and [workspaces](/exchange/troubleshoot/outlook-issues/create-book-workspace-outlook) are tied to a [building and floor](get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors.md), to be reflected in Places Finder.  

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Places Finder is an opt-in feature and will be replacing the Room Finder experience once enabled in Outlook on the Web, New Outlook for Windows, Outlook Desktop (Mac and Windows). For more information, see [Opt in to the Microsoft Places Public Preview](opt-in-places-preview.md).

Before you enable Places Finder, you must do the following:

- Create your building entities and floors and associate them to existing or new rooms and workspaces accounts. To learn how to quickly set up buildings and floors in Exchange, see [Quick setup of buildings and floors](get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors.md).

- Ensure that each resource account (room or workspace mailbox) has the necessary fields updated with accurate room and workspace data. We strongly recommend importing photos for each resource, otherwise a stock photo will be uploaded for each room. Recommended fields you can update are discussed later in this article.

## Enable Places Finder

Once you receive notification that you have access to the Places Finder feature, run the following **Places PowerShell** cmdlet to enable the opt-in features for a set of users in a security group.

```powershell
Set-PlacesSettings -Collection Places â€“PlacesFinderEnabled 'Default:false, OID:<Security Group OID>@<TenantId>:true'
```
## Frequently Asked Questions

### When I enable Places Finder for a certain set of users, will these users lose access to Room Finder?

Yes, once Places Finder is enabled, it will replace the Room Finder experience for that set of users. We recommend updating the building and floor entities of all rooms or workspaces of the assigned site or building the set of users regularly book from.

### How do I hide a room or workspace from showing in Places Finder?

Remove the building and floor entity (PlaceId) of the resource mailbox. Learn more about manually updating resource mailboxes by using [Set-PlaceV3](powershell/set-placev3.md).

### Where will I see Places Finder when enabled?

In the Places web app, you'll be introduced to Places Finder through multiple entry points.  

- You can find the Places Finder in the Places web app to book a conference room or desk.
