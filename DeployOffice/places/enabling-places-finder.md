# Enabling Places Finder in Outlook

Places Finder is a web-based feature that exists in Places to help employees find available conference [rooms](/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019) and [workspaces](/exchange/troubleshoot/outlook-issues/create-book-workspace-outlook). It has improved functionality from the existing Room Finder for employees to confidently choose the right place to meet and work productively.

## Overview of Places Finder

Like Room Finder, every meeting room and workspace must be set up in Exchange Online. Each of these spaces must be configured to have either a room mailbox or a workspace mailbox as a specific type of resource mailbox.  

For existing room and workspace mailboxes, Places Finder relies on a new location hierarchy to ensure all [rooms](/exchange/recipients/room-mailboxes?view=exchserver-2019) and [workspaces](/exchange/troubleshoot/outlook-issues/create-book-workspace-outlook) are tied to a [building and floor](get-started/quick-setup-buildings-floors.md), to be reflected in Places Finder.  

## Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> Places Finder is an opt-in feature and will be replacing the Room Finder experience once enabled in Outlook on the Web, New Outlook for Windows, Outlook Desktop (Mac and Windows). For more information, see [Opt in to the Microsoft Places Public Preview](opt-in-places-preview.md).

Before you begin, you must do the following tasks:

- Deploy the new Outlook for Windows or Outlook on the web. The experience will be coming to classic Outlook for Windows and Outlook for Mac at the end of June 2024.
- Create your building.
- Enable your maps.
- Install Enhanced Places.

## Enable Places Finder

Once you receive notification that you have access to the Places Finder feature, run the following PowerShell cmdlet to enable the opt-in features for your tenant.

```powershell
Set-PlacesSettings -Collection Places â€“PlacesFinderEnabled 'Default:false, OID<Security Group OID>@<TenantId>:true'
```
