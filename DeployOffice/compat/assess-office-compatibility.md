# Assess Office compatibility

***Applies to:*** *Office 2019, Office 2016*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is no longer supported in Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (as of Version 2208), and is removed in Version 2301 (and later).
> - For more information, see [Removal of Office Telemetry Dashboard from Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise](telemetry-dashboard-removal.md).
  
Keeping an Office deployment project on track requires two key aspects: using the right process to assess Office compatibility, and using tools that help you understand the potential risks of an Office upgrade. Office helps you do both. Using the process outlined in this article along with Office tools like the Office Telemetry Dashboard can accelerate your Office deployments, enabling users to transition smoothly to the new version of Office with minimal disruptions. This article explains the compatibility process and how the Office Telemetry Dashboard integrates into it.

## What is Office Telemetry Dashboard?

The Office Telemetry Dashboard, introduced in Office 2013, is a compatibility monitoring framework that replaced the Office 2010 compatibility tools: Office Migration Planning Manager (OMPM), Office Code Compatibility Inspector (OCCI), and Office Environment Assessment Tool (OEAT). When you use Office Telemetry Dashboard as part of the Office compatibility process, it helps minimize the time that you spend assessing Office compatibility. It also reduces the risks associated with an Office upgrade. 
  
Office Telemetry Dashboard works as follows: When an Office document or solution is loaded, used, closed, or raises an error in certain Office applications, the application adds a record about the event to a local data store. Each record includes a description of the problem and a link to more information. Inventory and usage data is also tracked.
  
How does Office Telemetry Dashboard work in earlier versions of Office? Office Telemetry Dashboard isn't built into Office 2003, Office 2007, and Office 2010. For those clients, which are no longer supported, you deploy an agent that collects information about the installed add-ins and the most recently used documents. Unlike newer Office clients, you don't receive application event data for these clients; however, you receive inventory and usage data. This data enables you to identify which applications are in use and which are likely important to your business. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Office Telemetry Dashboard is an on-premises tool that collects inventory, usage, and health data about the Office documents and solutions, such as add-ins, used in your organization. The data is primarily designed to help your organization with application compatibility testing.
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is stored in a SQL Server database controlled by your organization and the data collected is ***not*** sent to Microsoft. For more information, see [Data collected by the agent for Office Telemetry Dashboard](data-that-the-telemetry-agent-collects-in-office.md).
> - Data collected for Office Telemetry Dashboard is different than Office diagnostic data, which can be sent to Microsoft. For more information about Office diagnostic data, see [Overview of privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/overview-privacy-controls.md).
> - Settings used to manage Office Telemetry Dashboard have no impact on Office diagnostic data and vice versa. For more information about managing Office diagnostic data, see [Use policy settings to manage privacy controls for Microsoft 365 Apps](../privacy/manage-privacy-controls.md).

## The Office compatibility process

The Office compatibility tools address common issues that can make Office deployments difficult. These tools help by speeding up deployments, reducing the unknown factors in your deployment through reporting, and laying a foundation for future Office upgrades. For the best results, use the built-in compatibility infrastructure of Office and use a phased approach to assess Office compatibility.
  
**Phases of the Office compatibility process**

|Phase|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|![Icon for the Discover phase.](media/assess-office-compatibility/ork-compat-discover-reverse.png)|Discover what is being used, by whom, and how often. This information helps you determine what to test for compatibility with the version of Office you're upgrading. Documents and solutions that are used frequently and by multiple users are good candidates for testing.  <br/> |
|![Icon for the Rationalize phase.](media/assess-office-compatibility/ork-compat-rationalize-reverse.png)|Partner with business groups to identify what's critical to the business. The data that you find during the discovery phase can help jumpstart and guide this discussion. The goal is to identify the business-critical documents and solutions that have to be ready on the first day of your Office deployment.  <br/> |
|![Icon for the Validate phase.](media/assess-office-compatibility/ork-compat-validate-reverse.png)|Start a pilot deployment where users test the documents and solutions that are required to run the business by using Office. We call this user acceptance testing. Troubleshoot any issues that occur for documents and solutions that need to be ready on the first day of deployment.  <br/> |
|![Icon for the Manage phase.](media/assess-office-compatibility/ork-compat-manage-reverse.jpg)|Deploy Office and continue to monitor your documents and solutions. Watch for trends in Office performance and behavior as updated Office solutions are deployed. Use your Help Desk resources to troubleshoot issues as they occur for non-business-critical documents and solutions.  <br/> |
   
In this article, we discuss each phase of the compatibility process and describe how you can use Office Telemetry Dashboard to support the process.
  
<a name="discover"> </a>

## Phase 1: Discover which Office documents and solutions are being used

Your goal for the Discover phase is to know what's being used the most and by whom. There are two approaches that you can take to start the discovery process.
  
- The preferred approach is to start to deploy the Office Telemetry Agent to help you discover usage within monitored groups and then use those results to begin discussions with business groups.
    
- Consider partnering with your business groups and requesting a list of their business-critical documents and solutions. If they have a disaster recovery plan, you can likely find this list in their plan. The downside to this approach is that their lists might not be up-to-date. You should plan to use data to help refine these lists if you choose this approach.
    
Whether or not you start with a blank list, there's no avoiding working with your business groups. The tools can't tell you what's important to the business. The tools can give you some leads on what's important based on use, but only the business groups can tell you how dependent their business is on those documents and solutions. For example, relying solely on data can lead to oversights. You might miss templates for year-end sales reports or annual performance reviews. Other documents not in use at the time of data collection could also be overlooked.
  
Now it's time to start to make plans to deploy the agent to the existing Office clients. Here are some considerations to think about before you deploy the agent. Here are the requirements to deploy the agent in [Office Telemetry Agent](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#agent). For more information on deploying Office Telemetry Dashboard, see [Deploy Office Telemetry Dashboard](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md).
  
### Choose which Office client computers to monitor

We recommend that you monitor about 20% of the client computers across your organization. This sample should include representative users from every business group so that you can identify line-of-business solutions that are used within pockets of the organization. Make sure to include expert users in that sample and users who express interest in piloting Office. There might be cases in which monitoring a complete group or organizational unit (OU) is less restrictive or easier than selecting separate client computers to participate. Small organizations might also choose to monitor all client computers. 
  
### Identify privacy concerns with business group stakeholders

Some business groups, such as human resources, legal, and finance, might have concerns about exposing personal or sensitive files in the data. Office Telemetry Dashboard offers several ways to prevent exposing this data. For example, you can configure the agent to intentionally obscure file names and titles. You can also prevent data from certain applications from being reported. You can learn more about the privacy settings in [Manage the privacy of data monitored by Office Telemetry Dashboard](manage-the-privacy-of-data-monitored-by-telemetry-in-office.md). Review the privacy options with the business groups and decide which kinds of Office data that you want to exclude from reporting in Office Telemetry Dashboard. 
  
### Decide how you want to categorize clients that are shown in Office Telemetry Dashboard

When you deploy the agent to clients, you can specify up to four labels that describe the clients. These labels help you filter data in the dashboard so that you can focus on individual business groups, specific kinds of users, users in certain geographical locations, and so on. Develop this list as you work with business groups. You can learn more about how to configure labels when you [Deploy Office Telemetry Dashboard](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md), in the section [Enabling and configuring the agent](deploy-telemetry-dashboard.md#configure).
  
<a name="rationalize"> </a>

## Phase 2: Rationalize the inventory data to identify business-critical Office documents and solutions

The goal of the Rationalize phase is to identify business-critical Office documents and solutions. We recommend that you collect data in Office Telemetry Dashboard for at least one day before you start to look for trends.
  
The sections that follow helps you interpret the data, work with business groups, and decide what to test.
  
### Gain insights from data in Office Telemetry Dashboard

As data starts to populate in Office Telemetry Dashboard, you can start to look for usage trends. Here are some tips to get you started. 
  
- Look to see whether any departments or groups aren't represented but should be. For example, if there are no finance solutions being used, you might forget to enable monitoring for the finance group.
    
- Look for documents and solutions that are used by more than 10% of user as they're candidates for more evaluation.
    
- Look for documents that are used by three or more users. Is there a trend for coauthoring? Are these templates? You might find that fewer documents are shared than solutions.
    
- Jot down solutions that you know are important that you'll want to track in the future even if the user numbers are low.
    
- Look to see where documents were opened from. This information can help you differentiate between an attachment in an email message and a frequently edited document.
    
- Look for multiple file sizes of the same solution or document. It's an indication that multiple versions are being used. These files are candidates for future consolidation.
    
### Work with business groups to decide what Office documents and solutions to test

By now, you likely worked with business groups to identify their important documents and solutions. Compare the list they gave you with the usage data shown in the Office Telemetry Dashboard. Does the usage data support the input from the business groups? If not, could there be a seasonal explanation? For example, are some solutions used more towards the end of the fiscal year? It's worth having another conversation with business groups about any differences you find so that you can adjust your plans for user acceptance testing.
  
If you haven't worked with business groups yet, this is the time to approach them. The initial usage data can help you create a list of documents and solutions that are candidates for testing and remediation. But instead of assigning priority levels, such as high, medium, or low, it's better to rank documents and solutions by the type of testing they undergo. Ask your business groups to assign them to one of the choices in the following table:
  
**Classifying Office documents and solutions to test**

|Type of documents and solutions|Testing needed|
|:-----|:-----|
|Documents and solutions that IT is accountable for and must keep functioning at all costs  <br/> |**Proactive testing** <br/> These high-priority documents and solutions are tested, fixed, and ready for use on the first day of the Office deployment.  <br/> |
|Documents and solutions that IT fix if somebody calls about them  <br/> |**Reactive testing** <br/> These solutions are fixed only when a user reports an issue to your help desk.  <br/> |
|Documents and solutions that nobody cares about  <br/> |**Don't test** <br/> |
   
When you approach business groups to classify their documents and solutions, you might meet some resistance from business groups that assign everything to the high priority list. One of our Office compatibility experts, Chris Jackson, wrote an article for TechNet Magazine that describes some costs behind Office compatibility testing. You can use this information to help justify reactive testing and ease the emotional fears that often affect Office migrations. Read more at [Microsoft Office: The Mathematics of Office Compatibility](/previous-versions/technet-magazine/jj250906(v=msdn.10)).

## Phase 3: Validate that Office files and solutions work

After you complete the Discover and Rationalize phases, it's time to start to test the high priority documents and solutions for compatibility with Office. The goal of the Validate phase is to verify that the solutions and documents work in the environment that users need them to work in. This doesn't mean that the solution or document doesn't have bugs. It just means that the bugs don't prevent users from doing their work. 
  
Unfortunately, there's no tool that does this work for you. You have to ask users to test the documents and solutions by doing their work in Office. We call this user acceptance testing, and it's unavoidable. The good news is that user acceptance testing is much easier now with Click-to-Run, which helps transform user acceptance testing into piloting. Encourage users to use their documents and solutions in the new version of Office, and advise them to use their earlier version of Office if they encounter issues.
  
Data in Office Telemetry Dashboard is also a significant help in this phase because it can tell you what is broken and how. Office Telemetry Dashboard shows positive and negative trends that can help you quickly see the stability of documents or solutions as they're updated. 
  
Here are some guidelines to help you plan and monitor user acceptance testing.
  
### Identify users for user acceptance testing

Owners of the business-critical documents and solutions are strong candidates for taking part in user acceptance testing. By looking at the list that you generated during discovery, each department can identify the owners. If not, data can help by showing you most active users.
  
You should also recruit technical users within each department, because they're likely to know the details of how the solution or document works. Also look for a diverse base of testers across job levels, roles, and locations.
  
### Set up an environment for user acceptance testing

One important rule of user acceptance testing is that the test environment must be as similar to the production environment as possible. There are several ways to set up a test environment. You can set up a separate organizational unit (OU) within the production domain, or set up a separate test environment that is identical to the production environment. You want the test environment to be easy to set up and easy for users to access. The goal is to remove barriers to testing and to minimize complaints from users who say that there's no time to test. Your organization might already have a testing environment provisioned and centrally managed. If so, use it. If you don't have a test environment already, don't set one up. Use Click-to-Run instead.
  
Click-to-Run provides all the benefits of testing in production without all the risk. Installing Office by using Click-to-Run allows users to run their earlier versions of Office alongside the current version of Office. If a problem or incompatibility arises, users can still do their work by using the earlier version of Office.
  
It's easier to transform user acceptance testing into piloting when you use Click-to-Run. You deploy the new environment while keeping the previous one, and you can monitor the status of the Click-to-Run deployments of Office by using Office Telemetry Dashboard. You can see which builds are being used and the compatibility issues that are being reported. Monitoring user acceptance testing and piloting by using Office Telemetry Dashboard helps ease the fear of not knowing the effect of the new version. You can offer more information to business groups and Office solution owners beyond just status of the deployment.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> We recommend that you use side-by-side installations of Office as a temporary solution for user acceptance testing and piloting, not as a long-term solution for production environments. Plan to phase out the earlier version of Office when your production deployments begin. 
  

### Fix issues in high priority Office documents and solutions

By now, high priority documents and solutions that have to be ready on day one of deployment are identified and tested. In addition to bug reports from users, data in Office Telemetry Dashboard indicates how Word, Excel, and Microsoft Outlook perform when used with your existing Office documents and solutions. As you collect information about bugs and other issues, work with in-house developers and business group managers to create remediation plans. You need to decide whether to retire or fix in-house solutions and work with vendors to obtain updated versions of non-Microsoft products.
  
Both Office Telemetry Dashboard and Office Telemetry Log can help you during this process. You can monitor the health of Word, Excel, and Microsoft Outlook as you deploy incremental fixes or new versions of Office solutions. Developers can [use the Office Telemetry Log](/office/client-developer/shared/troubleshooting-office-files-and-custom-solutions-with-the-telemetry-log) to observe the compatibility events that occur on the local computer when Word, Excel, and Microsoft Outlook are used with existing documents and solutions. 
  
Your development teams might have automated testing tools that can help with the testing process. Tune the tools to flag and fix only issues that block deployment, ensuring readiness on the first day. It's probably not worth fixing bugs that don't affect the user's day-to-day work, at least not for day one. Those solutions can be fixed over time if it's necessary.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You may wonder whether it's a good idea to substitute vendor support statements with compatibility testing. Chris Jackson covers the cost pros and cons of researching vendor support in his article [Microsoft Office: The Mathematics of Office Compatibility](/previous-versions/technet-magazine/jj250906(v=msdn.10)).

## Phase 4: Manage the transition to the new version of Office

Your goals for the Manage phase are to use Office Telemetry Dashboard to monitor Office usage and add-ins and prepare users for the transition to Office. Set compatibility mode for Office to ensure that people using earlier versions have full editing capabilities when collaborating with users who have transitioned to the new version.
  
As you deploy Office, you'll start to see Office health and usage trends that help you unlock the value of your Office investments and give you insight for future deployments. For example, knowing what ActiveX controls are being used can help with future Windows updates. Is Excel being used not just as a spreadsheet tool, but as a front-end application that uses a data connection? How do new Office solutions affect the environment? When it's time for another Office deployment, you might be able to skip the discovery process entirely because you know exactly what's being used and what's important.
  
These sections provide more guidance about the Manage phase.
  
### Manage Office add-ins by using Office Telemetry Dashboard

As you monitor solutions that are used by Office, you're likely to find add-ins that are slow to load or that crash frequently. You might also find add-ins that shouldn't be used in your organization. Group Policy settings allow you to manage these add-ins when they're used with Office. 
  
Office Telemetry Dashboard provides an interface for configuring these settings. On the Solutions worksheet, select the **Add-in management** link at the top of the page, which brings you to the Add-in management worksheet. On that worksheet, you can see data about each add-in and select a Group Policy setting to control each add-in. Use the instructions on the worksheet to generate a script that you can run to apply the Group Policy to an Active Directory organizational unit. 
  
There are individual add-in management settings for each supported Office application. They're located in the following paths:
  
- User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\\_Office application name_\Miscellaneous\List of managed add-ins
    
- User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\\_Office application name_\Miscellaneous\Block all unmanaged add-ins
    
### Phase out earlier versions of Office

We recommend that you run a newer version of Office with an earlier version of Office side-by-side only as a short-term compatibility solution during pilot testing. When your pilot phase ends and production deployments begin, start removing earlier versions of Office from production computers running the newer version. This step prevents widespread issues caused by file type associations breaking after updates or repairs.
  
### Manage compatibility mode in Office

In Office, compatibility mode is used automatically to open documents that were created in earlier versions of Office applications. Compatibility mode blocks new or improved Office features for the document, ensuring users with earlier Office versions still have full editing capabilities. Compatibility mode also preserves the document's layout.
  
As part of your overall Office training plan, you should provide guidance to users about how compatibility mode works. For more information on administrative settings for compatibility mode, see [Manage compatibility mode for Office](manage-compatibility-mode-for-office.md). 
  
### Prepare help desk and users for change

Your Help Desk should be ramped up on Office and ready to support users. They should start by going to [Microsoft 365 Training](https://support.microsoft.com/training).
