# Use digital signatures with Office 2016

 **Summary:** Explains how to support XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES) in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word documents. Additionally, determine how to select the appropriate certificates for your deployment. 
  
  
Users digitally sign an Excel, PowerPoint, or Word document for many of the same reasons that they might place a handwritten signature on a paper document. A digital signature helps authenticate a creator's identity. It verifies the author of digital information, including documents, email messages, and macros. This process uses cryptographic algorithms. 
  
Certification authority (CA) issues digital certificates, which serve as verifiers of identity. These certificates form the basis of digital signatures. This works similarly to the use of printed identity documents. For example,  a government entity or employer issues identity documents such as driver licenses, passports, and employee ID cards. Other people rely on those documents to verify that a person is who they claim to be.
  
This article includes digital signature registry keys that are new to Office 2016.

## Introduction to digital signatures and how they're used in Office

Digital signatures help establish the following authentication measures:
  
- **Authenticity** The digital signature and its' underlying digital certificate help make sure that the signer is the person they claim to be. This helps prevent other people from pretending to be the originator of a particular document, the equivalent of forgery on a printed document. 
    
- **Integrity** The digital signature ensures that the content doesn't change or get tampered with after it's digitally signed. This digital signature prevents documents from being intercepted and altered without the knowledge of the document originator.
    
- **Non-repudiation** The digital signature helps prove to all parties the origin of the signed content. "Repudiation" refers to a signer's denial of any association with signed content. The digital signature helps prove that the originator of the document is the true originator and not someone else, regardless of the claims of the signer. A signer can't repudiate their signature on that document without also repudiating their digital key, which affects other documents signed with that key.
    
### Requirements for digital signatures in Office 2016

To establish these conditions, the content creator must digitally sign the content by creating a signature that satisfies the following criteria:
  
- The digital signature is valid. The operating system must trust the Certificate Authority (CA) that signs the digital certificate underpinning the digital signature.
    
- The certificate that is associated with the digital signature isn't expired or contains a time stamp that indicates the certificate was valid at the time of signing.
    
- The certificate that is associated with the digital signature isn't revoked.
    
- The recipient trusts the signing person or organization (known as the publisher).
    
Word 2016, Excel 2016, and PowerPoint 2016 detect these criteria and warn the user if there's a problem with the digital signature. Information about problematic certificates can easily be viewed in a certificate task pane that appears in the Office 2016 application. Office 2016 applications let you add multiple digital signatures to the same document.
  
### Digital signatures in the Office 2016 business environment

The following scenario shows how you can use digital signatures on documents in a business environment:
  
1. An employee uses Excel 2016 to create an expense report. The employee then creates three signature lines: one for themself, one for their manager, and one for the accounting department. The signatures serve to:
    
   - identify that the employee is the originator of the document
    
   - indicate that no changes occur in the document as it moves to the manager and the accounting department
    
   - demonstrate that there's proof that both the manager and the accounting department received and reviewed the document
    
2. The manager receives the document and adds their digital signature to the document, confirming that they reviewed and approved it. It's then forwarded to the accounting department for payment.
    
3. A representative in the accounting department receives the document and signs it, which confirms receipt of the document.
    
This example demonstrates the ability to add multiple signatures to a single Office 2016 document. In addition to the digital signature, the signer of the document can add a graphic of their actual signature, or use a Tablet PC to actually write a signature into the signature line in the document.

### Compatibility issues with Office documents prior to Office 2016

Office 2016, just as Office 2013, Office 2010 and Office 2007, uses the XML-DSig format for digital signatures. In addition, Office 2016 has support for XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signatures). XAdES is a set of tiered extensions to XML-DSig, the levels of which build upon the previous levels to provide more reliable digital signatures. For more information about the levels of XAdES that are supported in Office 2016, see [Planning digital signature levels in Office 2016 documents](digital-signatures.md#planlevels) later in this article. For more information about the details of XAdES, see the specification for [XML Advanced Electronic Signatures (XAdES)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=186631).
  
Digital signatures that are created in Office 2016 are incompatible with versions of Office that are earlier than the 2007 Office system. For example, consider a document signed using an application in Office 2016, Office 2013, Office 2010, or Office 2007. When a user opens this document in Office 2003 with the Office Compatibility Pack, the system notifies them. It informs that the document was signed in a newer version of Office. As a result, the digital signature is lost.
  
The following figure shows the warning that the user sees after opening a document in a version of Office that is earlier than Office 2007.
  
**Digital signature warning for documents originally signed in Office 2003 or earlier versions.**

![Figure 1 Compatibility Issues.](../../images/CompatibilityIssues.jpg)
  
If you use XAdES for a digital signature in Office 2016, the digital signature isn't compatible with Office 2010 or 2007 Office system unless you configure the Group Policy setting, **Do not include XAdES reference object in the manifest**, and set it to **Enabled**. For more information about the digital signature Group Policy settings, see [Plan signature settings for Office 2016](digital-signatures.md#configsigs) later in this article. 
  
If you want digital signatures that you create in Office 2016 to be compatible with Office 2003 and earlier versions, you can configure the Group Policy setting, **Legacy format signatures**, and set it to **Enabled**. This Group Policy setting is located under **User Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Microsoft Office 2016\Signing**. After you change this setting to **Enabled**, the Office 2016 applications use the Office 2003 binary format to apply digital signatures to Office 97-2003 binary documents that you created in Office 2016.

## Choosing digital certificate types for Office 2016

Certification Authorities (CAs) can issue digital certificates, or they can be self-signed. Within an organization, the process might involve a Windows Server 2012 computer running Active Directory Certificate Services. Alternatively, a public CA, such as VeriSign or Thawte, can issue them. Self-signed certificates are commonly used by individuals and small businesses. They choose this option when they don't wish to establish a public key infrastructure (PKI) for their organizations or purchase a commercial certificate.
  
The primary drawback of self-signed certificates lies in their limited utility. They're only effective when exchanging documents with people who personally know you. Individuals must also be confident that you're the actual originator of the document. When you use self-signed certificates, there's no external validation authenticity of your certificate. Each person receiving your signed document must manually decide whether to trust your certificate.
  
For larger organizations, two primary methods for obtaining digital certificates are available: certificates that are created by using an organization or corporation PKI and commercial certificates. Organizations that want to share signed documents only among other employees in the organization might prefer a corporate PKI to reduce costs. Organizations that want to share signed documents with people outside their organization might prefer to use commercial certificates.
  
### Certificates that are created by using an organization or corporation PKI

Organizations can create their own PKI. In this scenario, the company sets up one or more certification authorities (CAs) that can create digital certificates for computers and users throughout the company. When a company combines Active Directory Directory Services (AD DS) with their systems, they can establish a complete PKI solution. This integration ensures that all organization or corporate-managed computers have the necessary CA chain installed. Additionally, the system enables the automatic assignment of digital certificates to both users and computers. These certificates are crucial for document signing and encryption. This process allows for all employees in a company to automatically trust digital certificates (and, therefore, valid digital signatures) from other employees in the same company.
  
  
### Commercial certificates

You can purchase commercial certificates from a company whose line of business is to sell digital certificates. The main advantage of using commercial certificates is that the commercial certificate vendor's root CA certificate is automatically installed on the organization's Windows operating systems. This enables these computers to automatically trust the CAs. Unlike the organization or corporate PKI solution, commercial certificates enable you to share your signed documents with users who don't belong to your organization. 
  
There are three kinds of commercial certificates:
  
- **Class 1** Class 1 certificates are issued to people who have valid email addresses. Class 1 certificates are appropriate for digital signatures, encryption, and electronic access control for non-commercial transactions where proof of identity isn't required. 
    
- **Class 2** Class 2 certificates are issued to people and devices. Class two individual certificates are appropriate for digital signatures, encryption, and electronic access control in transactions where proof of identity that is based on information in the validating database is sufficient. Class 2 device certificates are appropriate for device authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption. 
    
- **Class 3** Class 3 certificates are issued to people, organizations, servers, devices, and administrators for CAs and root authorities (RAs). Class three individual certificates are appropriate for digital signatures, encryption, and access control in transactions where proof of identity must be assured. Class 3 server certificates are appropriate for server authentication; message, software, and content integrity; and confidentiality encryption.

## Planning digital signature levels in Office 2016 documents

Users can digitally sign documents by using Excel 2016, PowerPoint 2016, and Word 2016. They can also use Excel 2016, InfoPath 2016, or Word 2016 to add a signature line or signature stamp. Digitally signing a document that has a digital certificate but doesn't have a signature line or stamp is known as creating an invisible digital signature. Visible and invisible digital signatures both use a digital certificate for signing the document. The difference is the graphical representation in the document when a visible digital signature line is used. For more information about how to add a digital signature, see [Add or remove a digital signature in Office files](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=187659).
  
By default, Office 2016 creates XAdES-EPES digital signatures, when either a self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by a CA is used during the creation of the digital signature. 
  
The XAdES digital signature levels, which are based on the XML-DSig digital signature standard and available in Office 2016, are listed in the following table. Each of the levels builds upon the previous level and contains all the capabilities of the previous levels. For example, XAdES-X also contains all of the capabilities of XAdES-EPES, XAdES-T, and XAdES-C, in addition to the new functionality that is introduced in XAdES-X.
  
**XAdES digital signature levels in Office 2016**

|**Signature level**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|XAdES-EPES (Base)  <br/> |Adds information about the signing certificate to the XML-DSig signature. This setting is the default for Office 2016 signatures.  <br/> |
|XAdES-T (Timestamp)  <br/> |Adds a time stamp to the XML-DSig and XAdES-EPES sections of the signature, which helps protect against certificate expiration.  <br/> |
|XAdES-C (Complete)  <br/> |Adds references to certification chain and revocation status information.  <br/> |
|XAdES-X (Extended)  <br/> |Adds a time stamp to the XML-DSig SignatureValue element, and the -T and -C sections of the signature. The extra time stamp protects the data from repudiation.  <br/> |
|XAdES-X-L (Extended Long Term)  <br/> |Stores the actual certificate and certificate revocation information in addition to the signature. This approach allows for certificate validation even if the certificate servers are no longer available.  <br/> |
   
### Planning for time stamped digital signatures in Office 2016

When users add a time stamp to a digital signature, they help to extend the lifespan of that digital signature. For example, consider a scenario with a revoked certificate that was used to create a digital signature. The inclusion of a time stamp from a trusted time stamp server becomes critical in such a case. The key factor is the timing of the time stamp: if it was applied before the certificate was revoked, the digital signature can still be considered valid. To use the time stamp functionality with digital signatures, you must complete the following tasks:
  
- Set up a time stamp server that is compliant with RFC 3161.
    
- Use the Group Policy setting, **Specify server name**, to enter the location of the time stamp server on the network.
    
You can also configure other time stamp parameters by configuring one or more of the following Group Policy settings:
  
- **Configure time stamping hashing algorithm**
    
- **Set time stamp server time-out**
    
If you don't configure and enable **Configure time stamping hashing algorithm**, the default value of SHA1 is used. If you don't configure and enable **Set time stamp server time-out**, Office 2016 waits 5 seconds for the time stamp server to respond to a request.

### Plan signature settings for Office 2016

Group Policy provides settings for configuring time stamp related settings. Additionally, it offers settings to manage and control digital signatures within an organization. The setting names and descriptions are listed in the following table.
  
**Digital signature Group Policy configuration settings**

|**Group Policy Setting**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**Require OCSP at signature generation time** <br/> |You can set a policy in Office 2016 to ensure it checks for OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) revocation data. This check is necessary for all digital certificates in a chain when generating digital signatures.  <br/> |
|**Specify minimum XAdES level for digital signature generation** <br/> |This policy setting lets you specify a minimum XAdES level that Office 2016 applications must reach in order to create an XAdES digital signature. If the Office 2016 applications are unable to reach the minimum XAdES level, the Office application doesn't create the signature.  <br/> |
|**Check the XAdES portions of a digital signature** <br/> |This policy setting lets you specify whether Office 2016 checks the XAdES portions of a digital signature when validating a digital signature for a document.  <br/> |
|**Do not allow expired certificates when validating signatures** <br/> |This policy setting lets you configure whether Office 2016 applications accept expired digital certificates when verifying digital signatures.  <br/> |
|**Do not include XAdES reference object in the manifest** <br/> |This policy setting lets you determine whether an XAdES reference object appears in the manifest. You must configure this setting to **Enabled** if you want the 2007 Office system to be able to read Office 2016 signatures that contain XAdES content. Otherwise, the 2007 Office system considers signatures that contain XAdES content invalid.  <br/> |
|**Select digital signature hashing algorithm** <br/> |This policy setting lets you configure the hashing algorithm that Office 2016 applications use to confirm digital signatures.  <br/> |
|**Set signature verification level** <br/> |This policy setting lets you set the verification level that is used by Office 2016 applications when validating a digital signature.  <br/> |
|**Requested XAdES level for signature generation** <br/> |This policy setting lets you specify a requested or desired XAdES level in creating a digital signature.  <br/> |
   
The following Group Policy settings are related to digital signatures: 
  
- **Set default image directory**
    
- **EKU filtering**
    
- **Legacy format signatures**
    
- **Suppress Office Signing Providers**
    
- **Suppress external signature services command**

### Registry settings that apply to digital signatures


The following table shows Windows registry settings that are specific to digital signatures and the certificates that are used to encrypt them. These registry settings are located in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\software\policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\common\signatures. There's no corresponding Group Policy.
  
**Digital signature registry settings**

|**Registry entry**|**Type**|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|FilterIssuer  <br/> |WZ  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Reduces the set of available certificates to those that have the FilterIssuer value in their name.  <br/> |
|MinSigningDSABits  <br/> |DWORD  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the minimum number of bits that are allowed to create a DSA digital signature in Office.  <br/> |
|InvalidDSABits  <br/> |DWORD  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the maximum number of bits that are read in a DSA digital signature. Any bits beyond the InvalidDSABits value are ignored.  <br/> |
|InvalidHashAlg  <br/> |WZ  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the hash algorithms that were previously used by your organization to create digital signatures in previous releases of Office (Office 2007, Office 2010, for example) that you want to make invalid now. If a hash is specified here, validation fails for any documents or emails that use that hash to validate a digital signature.  <br/> |
|InvalidRSABits  <br/> |DWORD  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the maximum number of bits that are read in an RSA digital signature. Any bits beyond the InvalidRSABits value are ignored.  <br/> |
|LegacyDSABits  <br/> |DWORD  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the minimum number of bits that are processed in a legacy DSA digital signature, where legacy refers to a digital signature created for a document or email using Office 2007 or Office 2010 and where the hash algorithm was specified in the LegacyHashAlg registry key setting.  <br/> |
|LegacyHashAlg  <br/> |WZ  <br/> |MD5  <br/> |Define the hash algorithms your organization used for creating digital signatures in previous Office releases, such as Office 2007 and Office 2010. This step ensures the validation of legacy documents and emails that were digitally signed.  <br/> |
|LegacyRSABits  <br/> |DWORD  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the minimum number of bits that are processed in a legacy RSA digital signature. A digital signature created using Office 2007 or Office 2010 for a document or email is referred to as 'legacy.' In this context, the hash algorithm is specified through the LegacyHashAlg registry key setting.  <br/> |
|MinSigningRSABits  <br/> |DWORD  <br/> |Empty  <br/> |Specifies the minimum number of bits that are used to create a digital signature in Office 2016.  <br/> |
