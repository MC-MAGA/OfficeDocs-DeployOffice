You can use the following built-in Microsoft Entra roles for accessing and managing the feature:

| Role                       | Description       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Global Administrator       | This role can manage all aspects of Microsoft Entra ID and Microsoft services that use Microsoft Entra identities.
| Security Administrator     | This role can read security information and reports and manage configuration in Microsoft Entra ID and Office 365.
| Office Apps Administrator (**Recommended**) | This role can manage Office apps cloud services, including policy and settings management, and manage the ability to select, unselect, and publish 'what's new' feature content to end-user's devices.

> [!NOTE]
> Global Reader is another built-in role supported by the Microsoft 365 Apps admin center, but it does not support some features like cloud update or the Modern App Settings page.
