This preview includes Office LTSC 2024 for commercial Preview, Visio 2024 Preview, and Project 2024 Preview. It's important to note that this preview is for commercial users and isn't intended for home use. By participating in the preview, commercial customers can explore new features, test compatibility with existing systems, and provide valuable feedback to help refine the final release.

Preview versions of the following products are available for you to install and test on devices running Windows in your organization.

The following products are available as part of this preview program:

## What's new in Office LTSC Preview

Office LTSC 2024 builds upon the core functionalities of earlier versions, introducing several advancements to enhance productivity, security, and accessibility. This update includes new options for creating meetings and refined search capabilities in Outlook. Additionally, Excel receives a range of new features, such as Dynamic Charts and Arrays, marking significant improvements over the previous Office LTSC release.

While Office LTSC 2024 enhances various features, it doesn't include the AI and cloud-based functionalities available in Microsoft 365 Apps. Consequently, users won't have access to real-time collaboration, AI-driven automation in Excel, PowerPoint, and Word, or advanced security and compliance tools tailored for a hybrid work environment. The feature set of Office LTSC 2024 remains unchanged post-release, without the ongoing feature updates and cloud services provided in Microsoft 365 Apps.

## What’s changed in Office LTSC Preview

The installation and operation of Office LTSC 2024 for commercial Preview remain largely consistent with Office LTSC 2021, showing no significant differences.

However, it’s important to note a couple of changes. Office LTSC no longer includes Microsoft Publisher, as it's being [retired](https://support.microsoft.com/office/microsoft-publisher-will-no-longer-be-supported-after-october-2026-ee6302a2-4bc7-4841-babf-8e9be3acbfd7). Additionally, the Microsoft Teams app won't come preinstalled but is available for [download separately](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams/download-app#download-for-desktop).  

## What’s stayed the same in Office LTSC Preview

Office LTSC Preview keeps the same licensing and use rights as Office LTSC 2021, allowing for a straightforward experience for users familiar with the previous version. The deployment process also remains consistent, using the same software distribution tools, such as Microsoft Configuration Manager, that are currently used for deploying volume-licensed versions of Office LTSC 2021. 

## Getting support and providing feedback for Office LTSC Preview

Microsoft support isn’t available for the preview program.

Therefore, we recommend that you use the preview products only for testing purposes. For example, to familiarize yourself with deploying the preview products and using the new features in the Office apps. The preview products shouldn’t be used in your normal production environment or on a production device.
