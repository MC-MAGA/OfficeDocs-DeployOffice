## Install Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview)

To install Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview), perform the following steps:

1. [Download the installer package file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2159127) for Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview), and then install on the device. Or, if you have Office 2019 for Mac installed on the device, update your existing installation to at least Version 16.48.

3. Run the VL Serializer package file on the device to activate Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview). Once activated, the **About** dialog for the app will show **Preview 2021** as the license type.

Both the installer and VL Serializer package files follow the standard Apple PKG format. Therefore, you can use the same software distribution or mobile device management (MDM) tools that you normally use to deploy software to Mac users. For example, Jamf Pro or FileWave.

Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview) will be updated approximately once a month during the preview program. These updates will include, as needed, security updates and non-security updates, such as updates that provide stability or performance improvements for Office. You can use Microsoft AutoUpdate to detect, download, and apply these updates.

> - Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview) uses a special activation key that expired on January 17, 2022.
>
> - Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview) is now in reduced functionality mode, which means you’ll only be able to read and print documents in the Office apps. You won’t be able to create new documents or edit existing documents using Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview).

> - In Outlook, you’ll be able to read existing items that have been synchronized to your mailbox, but Outlook won’t be able to connect to your email server and synchronize more items.

## What’s changed in Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview)

Overall, there are no significant differences in how Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview) is installed and runs compared to Office 2019 for Mac.

There are two things that might be of interest to organizations:

- The VL Serializer has been improved so that a management tool can run the VL Serializer in the background even while the user still has Office 2019 for Mac apps open and running. The next time the user closes and opens the app, Office will switch over to using the Office LTSC for Mac 2021 license. This should help minimize user disruption when organizations move from Office 2019 for Mac to Office LTSC for Mac 2021.

- Several more Office Add-ins JavaScript APIs are available with Office LTSC for Mac 2021 (Preview). For more information, see [Office Add-ins](../ltsc2021/overview.md#office-add-ins).
